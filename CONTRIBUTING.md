Welcome to the contribution guidelines for 
our open-source game project! We are thrilled to 
have you interested in collaborating with us to 
create an exciting and engaging gaming experience.


To contribute to our project, 
you will need to use the LDTK level editor to create maps for the game. 
LDTK is a requirement of our project, as it has proven to be an efficient 
and reliable tool for creating high-quality maps that integrate seamlessly 
with our game engine.


We highly recommend using Pycharm as your editor of choice, 
as it has an exceptional conflict manager that will make your contributions 
smoother and more efficient.


We welcome contributions at all stages of the project and encourage you to make a Pull Request 
if you have an idea or feature you would like to contribute. Upon review and agreement, 
we will happily add you to our list of collaborators.


If you encounter any issues while contributing, please create an Issue in the dedicated section 
of our repository. This will allow us to quickly address any problems and continue improving our 
project.


In case you need to reach out to me for any reason, 
please don't hesitate to contact us through my discord:

Thank you for considering contributing to our open-source game project. 
We appreciate your time and efforts, 
and look forward to working with you towards our shared vision.
