# Stylish Slasher: Speed Run Edition

## Intro
Here is a game I originally made for Pygame Community Easter Jam 2023. But I fell in love with the Idea
So I'm planning to expand the project further than this.

## Game Play

Your goal in this game is to find as many diamonds as you can, as fast as you can.
you can arm yourself up with 6 different swords with different abilities,
you need some of them to gather certain diamonds.

```
1 - use UP,DOWN,RIGHT and LEFT to move.
2 - use A,S,D to move the camera.
3 - use 1,2,3,4,5,6 to switch between swords.
4 - use F for normal attacks and V for special attacks.
5 - use Q,W,E,R,T,G as shortcuts for special attacks.
```

## Requirements

You need `pygame-ce` same as or above version `2.2`.

The minimum `Python` version is `3.10`, but `3.11` is recommended for performance.

## How to Play

### *From Source*

you need to have `pygame-ce` (pygame community edition) installed.
if you don't have it, first uninstall pygame, and then install `pygame-ce`, with pip.

```commandline
pip uninstall pygame
pip install pygame-ce
```

and the clone the project, use `--depth 1` to only download the head of the branch.

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/mmdmoa/ParticleOverdose --depth 1
```

after that just enter the directory of the project and run the main file.

```commandline
python ./main.py
```
